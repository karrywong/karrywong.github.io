I am currently a Visiting Researcher with focus on 3D Mapping at Meta Reality Labs.

Background and Core Proficiencies
======
Versatile and collaborative software engineer utilizing 3 years in tech and research to deliver impactful algorithm and data structure solutions in machine learning and computer vision used in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). Applied math PhD, avid coder, and multilingual professional in software engineering. Highlights:
1. Strong background in 2D/3D geometry modeling and computational geometry; software engineering experience in AR/VR at Meta Reality Labs
2. Programming Languages: Python, C++ (intermediate), MATLAB, SQL (basic)
3. Strong understanding of algorithms & data structure with intensive training <https://leetcode.com/karrywong/>.
4. Languages: English, German, Mandarin (fluent), Cantonese (native), and Hebrew (conversational)

Biography ([CV](https://karrywong.github.io/files/CV_kawaiWONG.pdf)) - "What makes me unique?"
======
* I first worked at a US national lab on 3D reconstruction algorithm to further nuclear fusion research, then at Meta Reality Labs on 3D mapping algorithms in computer vision, e.g. for large-scale 3D reconstruction, user localization, structure from motion etc, on next-generation AR/VR devices. I grew fast and thrived in both environments. *This demonstrates my versatile engineering skills, great adaptability, and my strong desire for new opportunities and challenges!*

* I always picked up the local language in the country where I studied and I master it well (e.g. German and Hebrew!) *It shows my drive and innate ability, not only to quickly adapt myself to a new environment, but also to succeed! Knowing many languages is a big plus in the industry and business world!*

* Computational differential geometry is not easy. I show via my math PhD that *I can handle deep technical subjects and that the strong analytical skills I've learned can be applied to other fields!*

<!--I completed my M.Sc. at [the Technical University of Munich](https://www.ma.tum.de) in 2015 and B.Sc. at the [Hong Kong University of Science Technology](http://www.math.ust.hk) in 2011. I completed my master's thesis on [optimal surface embedding](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285206534_Optimal_Isometric_Embeddings_of_surfaces_in_3-dimensional_spaces) at the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://mathematics.huji.ac.il) under the guidance of [Raz Kupferman](https://razkupferman.wixsite.com/mysite). Prior to my graduate studies in the US, I worked in Germany as a software test engineer at Rohde & Schwarz and interned briefly at Siemens. -->

<!--Outside my research work, I am currently a passionate learner of machine learning and data science. I want to explore their potential applications to shape comparison and problems in limited view computed tomography.  -->

<!--Moreover, I am an avid world traveler and have great enthusiasm to learn different foreign languages - native in Cantonese, fluent in English, German, and Mandarin, conversational in Hebrew!-->
