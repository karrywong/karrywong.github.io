I am a graduate student in applied mathematics at [University of California, Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/). My research focuses on computational geometry and topology. I have been working on applying [conformalized mean curvature flow](https://karrywong.github.io/publication/Application_Of_Mean_Curvature_Flow_For_Surface_Parametrizations) to obtain conformal parametrizations of surfaces. My work is part of a larger project on [shape comaprison](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2015.0795). I am fortunate to be advised by [Joel Hass](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hass/) and [Patrice Koehl](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~koehl/index.html).

In parallel, I have been working as a student intern on 3-D electron temperature measurement and x-ray emission tomography of nuclear fusion hotspot at the [National Ignition Facility](https://lasers.llnl.gov) in the [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov) since December 2019. I work with Dr. [Benjamin Bachmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rpVopGoAAAAJ&hl=en). My work enables me to dive into the field of [high energy density science](https://heds-center.llnl.gov). Here is a 3-minute [SLAM talk](https://youtu.be/m72JuuaUUJI) to summarize my work.

Biography
======
I completed my M.Sc. at [the Technical University of Munich](https://www.ma.tum.de) in 2015 and B.Sc. at the [Hong Kong University of Science Technology](http://www.math.ust.hk) in 2011. I completed my master's thesis on [optimal surface embedding](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285206534_Optimal_Isometric_Embeddings_of_surfaces_in_3-dimensional_spaces) at the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://mathematics.huji.ac.il) under the guidance of [Raz Kupferman](https://razkupferman.wixsite.com/mysite). Prior to my graduate studies in the US, I worked in Germany as a software test engineer at Rohde & Schwarz and interned briefly at Siemens. 

Outside my research work, I am currently a passionate learner of machine learning and data science. I want to explore their potential applications to shape comparison and problems in limited view computed tomography.  

Moreover, I am an avid world traveler and have great enthusiasm to learn different foreign languages - native in Cantonese, fluent in English, German, and Mandarin, conversational in Hebrew!
