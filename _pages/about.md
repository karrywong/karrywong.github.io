I am looking for a full-time employment as a software engineer or a data scientist starting from January 2022. 
Computational math PhD, avid and competitive coder, and multilingual professional in software engineering and data science. Strong drive and innate ability in facing challenges and to deliver impactful engineering, data, and ML solutions. Highlights:
1. Strong background in 2D/3D geometry modeling and computational geometry.
2. Strong understanding of algorithms & data structure with intensive training <https://leetcode.com/karrywong/>.
3. Multiple industrial internship experiences in procedural & templated-based programming, object-oriented programming, and software development.
4. Proficient in Python, C/C++, MATLAB, and have basics in R, Fortran. See Github.
5. Fluent – English, German, Mandarin; Native – Cantonese; Conversational – Hebrew.

My contact is < ucdwong [at] ucdavis [dot] edu >.


<!--I am a graduate student in applied mathematics at [University of California, Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/). My research focuses on computational geometry and topology. I have been working on applying [conformalized mean curvature flow](https://karrywong.github.io/publication/Application_Of_Mean_Curvature_Flow_For_Surface_Parametrizations) to obtain conformal parametrizations of surfaces. My work is part of a larger project on [shape comaprison](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2015.0795). I am fortunate to be advised by [Joel Hass](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hass/) and [Patrice Koehl](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~koehl/index.html).-->

<!--In parallel, I have been working as a student intern on 3-D electron temperature measurement and x-ray emission tomography of nuclear fusion hotspot at the [National Ignition Facility](https://lasers.llnl.gov) in the [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov) since December 2019. I work with Dr. [Benjamin Bachmann](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rpVopGoAAAAJ&hl=en). My work enables me to dive into the field of [high energy density science](https://heds-center.llnl.gov). Here is a 3-minute [SLAM talk](https://youtu.be/m72JuuaUUJI) to summarize my work.-->
 
Biography ([resume](https://karrywong.github.io/files/CV_kawaiWONG.pdf)) - "What makes me unique?"
======
* I studied at a variety of institutions in different countries (Hong Kong, Germany, Israel, and the US). *This demonstrates my natural curiosity to understand the world and my strong desire for new opportunities and challenges!*

* I always picked up the local language in the country where I studied and I master it well (e.g. German and Hebrew!) *It shows my drive and innate ability, not only to quickly adapt myself to a new environment, but also to succeed! Knowing many languages is a big plus in the industry and business world!*

* Computational differential geometry is not easy. I show via my math PhD that *I can handle deep technical subjects and that the strong analytical skills I've learned can be applied to other fields!*

<!--I completed my M.Sc. at [the Technical University of Munich](https://www.ma.tum.de) in 2015 and B.Sc. at the [Hong Kong University of Science Technology](http://www.math.ust.hk) in 2011. I completed my master's thesis on [optimal surface embedding](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285206534_Optimal_Isometric_Embeddings_of_surfaces_in_3-dimensional_spaces) at the [Hebrew University of Jerusalem](https://mathematics.huji.ac.il) under the guidance of [Raz Kupferman](https://razkupferman.wixsite.com/mysite). Prior to my graduate studies in the US, I worked in Germany as a software test engineer at Rohde & Schwarz and interned briefly at Siemens. -->

<!--Outside my research work, I am currently a passionate learner of machine learning and data science. I want to explore their potential applications to shape comparison and problems in limited view computed tomography.  -->

<!--Moreover, I am an avid world traveler and have great enthusiasm to learn different foreign languages - native in Cantonese, fluent in English, German, and Mandarin, conversational in Hebrew!-->
