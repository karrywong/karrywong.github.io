collection: publications
permalink: /publication/llnl
excerpt: We present a novel approach to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) electron temperature distributions of inertially confined fusion plasma hotspots at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Using very limited number of two-dimensional (2D) x-ray imaging lines-of-sight, we perform 3D reconstructions of x-ray emission distributions from different x-ray energy channels ranging from 20 to 30 keV. 2D time-integrated x-ray images are processed using the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) to reconstruct a 3D hotspot x-ray emission distribution that is self-consistent with the input images. 3D electron temperatures are computed using the energy channel ratios. We demonstrate the high accuracy and applicability of this method with different complex hotspot geometries in both synthetic and experimental results.
