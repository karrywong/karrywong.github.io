collection: publications
permalink: /publication/llnl_paper
excerpt: 'We have presented a novel approach to reconstruct 3D x-ray emission distribution of hotspot from very limited number of 2D x-ray images in intertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments on the National Ignition Facility (NIF). We have also inferred the 3D hotspot electron temperature by using the reconstructed x-ray emission distributions from different x-ray energy channels ranging from 20 to 30keV.'

We have presented a novel approach to reconstruct 3D x-ray emission distribution of hotspot from very limited number of 2D x-ray images in intertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments on the National Ignition Facility (NIF). We have also inferred the 3D hotspot electron temperature by using the reconstructed x-ray emission distributions from different x-ray energy channels ranging from 20 to 30keV.
